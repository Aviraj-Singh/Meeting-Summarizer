# Meeting-Summarizer

## Problem Statement

Majority of leaders and executive of any organization spend more than 20 hours a week on meetings. Unless one joins, there is no atomated way to get a glimpse of Important Decisions Made. Also about 50% of the time spet on meeting in majority of the meeting is not measurable in any aspect.

## My Solution

Optimising meeting performance by providing a Meeting Summary of the recorded meeting. Thus, one can read summary whenever needed.
